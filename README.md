Hello there!

### About Me üë¶üèª
My name is Palm and I am 13 years old (as in 2021/12/18).  
I'm from Thailand and I have experience with Javascript and Typescript.  
I'm also a full stack developer, who uses React and ExpressJS.  

### Experience ‚ú®
I've started programming when I was 11 and started with the worst language possible... Windows Batch.  
Then as I was turning 12, I start to do Discord bot programming with Javascript.  
I start to take it more seriously from there on and learned Typescript, then HTML, CSS, and then, here we are! ReactJS!  
It was a fun journey, along the way I've discovered a lot of new knowledge which I would probably never heard if I didn't have the motivation.  

### Motivation üí¶
When I started at first, I have no motivation at all. It was just playing around with the code and usually never discover new things.  
Later then, I was setting up a Discord server and wish to program my own bot to do things, and that's when I started to learn Javascript.  
At first, I was just copy-pasting codes. Which is a really bad practice, and somehow, I can finally read documentations...  
Yeah, it was a little awkward to say that... I somehow knew how to read documentation cause I realized something was a "class".  
Then from there on, I just read documentations to learn new things, and here we are! In the present!

### Projects üìë
I haven't done many public projects, but I will list them all here.  
 - [Birb.js](https://github.com/BirbJS/Birb): A Discord API wrapper to make it a lot easier to connect a Discord bot to the API  
 - [birbjs-template-bot](https://github.com/PalmDevs/birbjs-template-bot): Unofficial Birb.js template bot for easier management, but not for large scale.  

My projects are usually private; I was working on a multi-purpose Discord bot, but it was discontinued... unfortunately.
