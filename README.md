### Hello there! 👋
## About Me 👦🏻
My name is Palm and I am 13 years old (as in 2021/12/18).
I'm from Thailand and I have experience with Javascript and Typescript.
I'm also a full stack developer, uses React and ExpressJS.

## Experience ✨
I've started programming when I was 11 and started with the worst language possible... Windows Batch.
Then as I was turning 12, I start to do Discord bot programming with Javascript.
I start to take it more serious from there on and learned Typescript, then HTML, CSS, and then, ReactJS!
It was a fun journey, along the way I've discovered a lot of new stuff which I would probably never heard if I didn't have motivation.

## Motivation 💦
When I started at first, I have no motivation at all. It was just playing around with the code.
And then, I was setting up a Discord server and wish to program my own bot to do things, and that's when I learned Javascript.
At first, I was just copy-pasting codes. Which is a really bad practice, and somehow, I can finally read documentations...
Yeah, it was a little awkward to say that... I somehow knew how to read documentation cause I realized something was a "class".
Then from there on, I just read documentations to learn new things, and here we are! In 2021!
