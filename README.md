# Hello there! 👋
Hello there, you seem to have discovered my about me page!

### About Me 👦🏻
My name is Palm and I am 13 years old (as in 2022/03/25).  
I'm from Thailand and I have experience with Javascript and Typescript (and also JSX, TSX).  
I'm also a full stack developer, who uses React and Express.js, sometimes just Next.js.  

### Experience ✨
I've started programming when I was 11 and started with the Windows Batch...  
Then as I was turning 12, I start to do Discord bot programming with Javascript.  
I start to take it more seriously from there on and learned Typescript, then HTML, CSS, and then, here we are. JSX and TSX!  
It was a fun journey, along the way I've discovered a lot of new knowledge which I would probably never get to learn if I didn't have motivation.  

### Motivation 💦
When I started at first, I have no motivation at all. I was just playing around with the code and usually never discover new things.  
Later then, I was setting up a Discord server and wish to program my own bot to do things, and that's when I started to learn Javascript.  
At first, I was just copy-pasting codes. Which is a really bad practice, and those codes got stuck in my head, and then I figured out how to read documentations!  
And from there on, I just read documentations to learn new things, and here we are! In the present!

### Projects 📑
I haven't done many public projects, but I will list them all here.  
 - [Birb.js](https://github.com/BirbJS/Birb): A Discord API wrapper to make it a lot easier to connect a Discord bot to the API  
 - [birbjs-template-bot](https://github.com/PalmDevs/birbjs-template-bot): Unofficial Birb.js template bot for easier management, but not for large scale.  
 - [Shidscript](https://github.com/shidscript/shidscript): When a programming joke becomes real...  

I'm currently working on Shidscript; other projects are not as active.
