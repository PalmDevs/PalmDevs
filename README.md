# Hello there! 👋
Hello there, you seem to have discovered my about me page!

### About Me 👦🏻
My name is Palm and I am 14 years old (as of 17/07/2022).  
I'm from Thailand and I have experience with Javascript and Typescript (and also JSX, TSX).  
I'm also a full stack developer, who uses React and Express.js, sometimes just Next.js.  

### Experience ✨
I've started programming when I was 11, didn't take it too seriously and just play along with some code.  
Then as I was turning 12, I start to do Discord bot programming with Javascript.  
I start to take it more seriously from there on and learned TypeScript, then frontend stuff. And lastly, JSX and TSX!  
It was a fun journey. I've discovered a lot of new knowledge which I'd have probably never get to have if I didn't have the motivation to do so.  

### Motivation 💦
When I started at first, I have no motivation at all. I was just playing around with the code. 
Later then, I was setting up a Discord server and wish to program my own bot to do things, and that's when I started to learn Javascript.  
At first, I was just copy-pasting code. Which is a really bad practice, but those snippet got stuck in my head, and I magically get how things work!
I began reading more documentation, which I thought was useless at first. But as I read more of it, I think they are a good use now. And here we are, me slamming my head into the keyboard trying to figure out why TypeScript is complaning.

### Projects 📑
*I'm currently tired and programming and things overall. I will catch them back one day!*

Though I haven't done many public projects, I can list them all here.  
 - [Nighty Development](https://github.com/nightybot): Anything about Discord bots, but open-source!
 - [Shidscript](https://github.com/shidscript/shidscript): Started with a joke, grew into ideas, and it isn't here yet!
