# Hello there! 👋
Hello there, you discovered my about me page!

### About Me 👦🏻
My name is Palm and I am 14 years old.  
I'm from Thailand and I have experience with both JavaScript and TypeScript.  
I'm also a full-stack developer, who uses React and Fastify.  

### Experience ✨
I've started programming when I was 11. I didn't take it too seriously and was just playing around with some code.  
Then as I was turning 12, I start to do Discord bot programming with JavaScript. It was a rogue start, though I managed to continue doing so!  
I started to take it more seriously from there on and learned TypeScript, then React!  
It was a fun journey. I've discovered a lot of knowledge which I'd have probably never get to have if I didn't have the motivation to do so.  

### Motivation 💦
When I started at first, I have no motivation at all. I was just playing around with some code. If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it just doesn't. 
Later then, I was setting up a Discord server and wish to program my own bot to do things, and that's when I started to learn JavaScript.  
At first, I was just copy-pasting code. Which is a really bad practice, but eventually I learned how to read documentation.
I began reading more documentation, which I thought was useless at first. But as I read more of it, I think they are a good use now. And here we are, me slamming my head into the keyboard trying to figure out why TypeScript is complaining.

### Projects 📑
Though I haven't done many public projects, I can list them all here.  
 - [ReVanced](https://github.com/revanced): I contribute to some of ReVanced's source. ReVanced is a project that continues the legacy of Vanced
 - [NRVM](https://github.com/PalmDevs/nrvm): Just another ReVanced builder
 - [Nighty Development](https://github.com/nightybot): Anything about Discord bots, but open-source! (paused)
 - [Shidscript](https://github.com/shidscript/shidscript): Started with a joke, grew into ideas, and it isn't here yet! (paused)
